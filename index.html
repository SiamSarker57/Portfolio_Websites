    <p>Hi, I’m Md. Siam Sarker, a 4th-year student at Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University, pursuing a B.Sc. (Engg.) in ICT (Information and Communication Technology). I’m passionate about software development and problem-solving, and I’m eager to apply my skills in real-world projects.</p>

    <p>I have experience with multiple programming languages, including C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My academic journey has involved working on various projects that range from web development to system-level programming, helping me develop both my technical skills and my ability to collaborate effectively with teams.</p>

    <p>I enjoy breaking down complex problems and finding creative, efficient solutions. As I continue my studies, I’m excited to expand my knowledge in areas such as full-stack development and software engineering best practices.</p>
